  <h1>PALAKKAD</h1>
  <p>Palghat or Palakkad is one of the fourteen revenue districts of Kerala. Its geographical position, historical background, rural nature, educational status, tourist attractions and above all, the developmental activities are wide and varied.

    This district, situated almost in the centre of the State, has no coastal line. The district opens the State to the rest of the country through the Palakkad gap. This 32 to 42 km. wide natural gap in the 960 km. long Western Ghats, is perhaps the most influential factor for the unique characteristics of the district such as climate, commercial as well as cultural exchanges between the State and the rest of the country. Palakkad witnessed invasions of historical importance that have left indelible impressions on the history of Kerala. Bharathapuzha, the longest river in Kerala, originates form the highlands and flows through the entire district. Forests, numerous streams, several dams and the gardens have made this district a tourist paradise.
    
    The district is one of the main granaries of Kerala and its economy is primarily agricultural. Agriculture engages more than 65 per cent of the workers and 88.9 per cent of the district's population is rural in nature. The proximity and easy approach to Tamil Nadu have caused the admixture of Malayalam and Tamil culture, here.
    
    This district is perhaps the foremost in fostering Carnatic music. Great musicians like Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar and Palakkad Mani Iyer, who have enriched carnatic music by their contributions, hailed from this district.</p>
