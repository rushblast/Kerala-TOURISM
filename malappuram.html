    <h1>Malappuram</h1>
    <p>The word “Malappuram” (terraced place atop the hills) came to represent the present region only after the formation of the district, before it was called Eranad or Valluvanad

        The district has a rich cultural and political heritage. From the time immemorial the port of Ponnani (sometimes roughly identified withTyndis) was a centre of trade with the Romans. After the Cheras, numerous powerful dynasties controlled the area, and by 9th century the region came to hands of the Kulasekharas of Mahodayapuram. After the disintegration of the Kulasekhara kingdom a number of Naircity states emerged called Valluvanad, Vettathunad, Parappanad, Nediyiruppu (the Zamorins) and more. But, from 13th century theSamoothiri of Calicut expanded their territories to the whole of Malabar. Thirunavaya, the seat of Mamankam, was in Malappuram district. European colonial powers landed in Malabar in 15th century, and changed the course of the history. The petty vassals of theSamoothiris often allied with the foreign powers against their rule. In 18th century, the de facto rulers of Mysore kingdom, Hyder Ali andTipu Sultan, marched to Samoothiris’ districts.
        
        Malappuram has seen participation in movements such as Khilafat Movement and Moplah ebellion in the early 20th century.
        
        Before Indian independence in 1947, Malappuram was a part of Malabar District in he Madras Presidency ofBritish India. The area covered by the present district was administered as  part of Kozhikode, Eranad taluk, Valluvanad Taluk and Ponnani taluk. Malabar District remained art of Madras state for some time after Indian independence. On 1 November 1956, Malabar District was merged with Travancore-Cochin to form the state of Kerala. Large-scale changes in
        the territorial jurisdiction of this tract took place in 1957 and 1969. On 1 January 1957, Tirur taluk was newly formed, taking portions of Eranad taluk and Ponnani taluks. Another portion of Ponnani taluk was transferred to the newly formed Chavakkad taluk. The residuary portion constitutes presentdayPonnani taluk. Perinthalmanna Taluk was a new taluk formed out of the erstwhilePerinthalmanna Taluk. Of these, Eranad Taluk and Tirur continued under Kozhikode District and Perinthalmanna Taluk as well as Ponnani taluk under the Palakkad District. The new district of Malappuramwasformed with four taluks, Eranad Taluk, Perinthalmanna Taluk, Tirur Taluk and Ponnani Taluk, four statutory towns, fourteen developmental blocks and 95 panchayats. Two more taluks,namely Tirurangadi taluk and Nilambur taluk, were formed later by bifurcating Tirur Taluk and Eranad taluk.</p>
