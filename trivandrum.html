        <h1>TRIVANDRUM</h1>
        <p>A gracious and evergreen city spread over seven hills, Thiruvananthapuram, capital of Kerala, is steeped in history and culture. Located in the extreme south of the state, its shores are washed by the warm waters of the Arabian Sea. This is a city where time moves gracefully with the day unfolding according to time honoured rhythms, qualities which make it one of the best cities in the country. Holding fort in the heart of the capital is Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple which is dedicated to Lord Vishnu who reclines on the serpent Anantha and after whom the city is named. Formerly called Trivandrum, the city’s original name was restored in 1991.
            As the visitor moves around the city he or she cannot fail to notice many traditional elements of Kerala culture that have been passed down from generations. From temple elephants swaggering down a street to traditionally dressed women and men as well as people eating off banana leaves, the sights are many and often found only in this part of the country.

Thiruvananthapuram is cutting edge too. The city occupies pride of place in India’s space research programme and is home to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre as well as several other institutions such as the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Technopark and the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management. Students from all over Kerala make a beeline for its many colleges and professional institutes to advance their prospects.

This salubrious city is today a magnet for tourists, businessmen and professionals. For many of them it captures the essence of Kerala and is an ideal springboard from which to venture into the rest of the state. The city sprang into the nation’s consciousness in 2011 with the discovery of a hoard of treasure at Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Hundreds of valuable items had accumulated over the centuries as gifts from the rulers of Travancore to the temple and is said to be worth over Rs 1 trillion. A rich legacy indeed!
