        <span>Brief History of Alappuzha</span>
        The district of Alappuzha was formed in 1957. But the place has a long and rich historical as well as the mythological past. Kuttanad which is called the Rice Bowl of Kerala is the long land form with a huge stretch of paddy fields, rows of coconut and palm trees and numerous water bodies is the main physical characteristic of this place.
        
        Historical evidences say that Alappuzha had its trade history with Greece and Portugal. Especially the Portuguese merchants and travelers had long been coming to this place since they arrived at Calicut. Therefore, besides trading, the Portuguese started preaching Catholicism and baptizing the resident Syrian Christians. But during 17th century the Portuguese influence started falling and the Dutch took important place and position in Alappuzha. They used to trade the spices mainly ginger, pepper and cinnamon, etc from here. But eventually they started spreading their inevitable influence on the culture and political affairs in Alappuzha until the ‘Maker of Modern Travancore’ Maharaja Marthanda Varma interceded.
        
         
        
        
        Besides giving the Dutch a strong setback from the political picture of Alappuzha by making copious annexations between the native kingdoms of Alappuzha and surrounding localities, Maharaja Marthanda Varma did several important developments for Alappuzha.
        After Maharaja Marthanda Varma, Alappuzha saw the maximum internal growth as a prosperous town during the reign of Dharmaraja and Raja Kesava Dasa, the ‘Maker of Modern Alleppey”.Raja Kesava Dasa played a significant role to make Alappuzha a prime Port-Town. During his rule several roadways, waterways, tradeways, canals, etc were made to ease out ways for commercial usage. Under the rule of Maharaja Balaramavarma there were lot of internal development done. The place got its first post and telegraph office, judicial courts, some well-equipped factories and the Town Development Committee.

Under the British rule, Alappuzha also witnessed many movements including rigorous fights for freedom and struggles of Punnapra and Vayalar which was historically renowned as the movement against the then Diwan of Travancore, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. Another significant movement which made Alappuzha a socially conscious town was the campaign against untouchability led by a brave journalist T. K. Madhavan. This led the famous Ambalappuzha Shree Krishna Swami Temple to be open for all Hindus irrespective of their individual castes.
Alappuzha also has its mythological linkage to the great epic Mahabharata. It is believed that Pandavas visited Alappuzha while on exile and stayed for a couple of months over here. A natural rock declaring the connection between Alappuzha and Pandavas do still exist in this city
